Hackathon Project to Make a Privacy day Campaign for Jan 28 2016

- personal data  is the rocket fuel for the Future of Commerce but, people have lost control of it
- To fix this: how do we Create a New Deal on Data 

- Lets create a  Hackathon Project to Make a Privacy day Campaign for Jan 28 2016
- Call all writers, promoters, actavists, legal hackers
- The Proejct idea is to makea a massive civic campaign 
- Make a button people press that sends a legal request to a company to manage or control consent
- we will use the hackathon to legally hack the ideas and processes for this button

- two things want to hack is:
1. the ability for people to independantly manage cosnet/privacy (not have to log into cmpanies silo's)
2. ability for people to make multiple privacy/consent based requests with the press of one button. 

- The result will be a brilliant Privacy Day Campaign that we can use with the latest thinking and technologies in privacy, consent data control 
for the next Jan

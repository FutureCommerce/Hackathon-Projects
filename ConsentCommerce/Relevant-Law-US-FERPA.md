# What are the Rights of Inspection and Review of Education Records?

## § 99.10 What rights exist for a parent or eligible student to inspect and review education records?

(a) Except as limited under § 99.12, a
parent or eligible student must be given
the opportunity to inspect and review the
student's education records. This
provision applies to
(1) Any educational agency or
institution; and
(2) Any State educational agency (SEA)
and its components.
(i) For the purposes of subpart B of this
part, an SEA and its components
constitute an educational agency or
institution.
(ii) An SEA and its components are
subject to subpart B of this part if the
SEA maintains education records on
students who are or have been in
attendance at any school of an
educational agency or institution subject
to the Act and this part.
(b) The educational agency or
institution, or SEA or its component,
shall comply with a request for access to
records within a reasonable period of
time, but not more than 45 days after it
has received the request.
(c) The educational agency or institution,
or SEA or its component, shall respond
to reasonable requests for explanations
and interpretations of the records.
(d) If circumstances effectively prevent
the parent or eligible student from
exercising the right to inspect and review
the student's education records, the
educational agency or institution,
(1) Provide the parent or eligible student
with a copy of the records requested; or
(2) Make other arrangements for the
parent or eligible student to inspect and
review the requested records.
(e) The educational agency or institution,
or SEA or its component, shall not
destroy any education records if there is
an outstanding request to inspect and
review the records under this section.
(f) While an educational agency or
institution is not required to give an
eligible student access to treatment
records under paragraph (b)(4) of the
definition of "Education records" in
§ 99.3, the student may have those
records reviewed by a physician or other
appropriate professional of the student's
choice.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1232g(a)(1)(A) and (B))

## § 99.11 May an educational agency or institution charge a fee for copies of education records?

(a) Unless the imposition of a fee
effectively prevents a parent or eligible
student from exercising the right to
inspect and review the student's
education records, an educational agency
or institution may charge a fee for a copy
of an education record which is made for
the parent or eligible student.
(b) An educational agency or institution
may not charge a fee to search for or to
retrieve the education records of a
student.
(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1232g(a)(1))

## § 99.12 What limitations exist on the right to inspect and review records?


(a) If the education records of a student
contain information on more than one
student, the parent or eligible student
may inspect and review or be informed
of only the specific information about
that student.
(b) A postsecondary institution does not
have to permit a student to inspect and
review education records that are:
(1) Financial records, including any
information those records contain, of his
or her parents;
(2) Confidential letters and confidential
statements of recommendation placed in
the education records of the student
before January 1, 1975, as long as the
statements are used only for the purposes
for which they were specifically
intended; and
(3) Confidential letters and confidential
statements of recommendation placed in
the student's education records after
January 1, 1975, if:
(i) The student has waived his or her
right to inspect and review those letters
and statements; and
(ii) Those letters and statements are
related to the student's:
(A) Admission to an educational
institution;
(B) Application for employment; or
(C) Receipt of an honor or honorary
recognition.
(c)(1) A waiver under paragraph
(b)(3)(i) of this section is valid only if:
(i) The educational agency or institution
does not require the waiver as a
condition for admission to or receipt of a
service or benefit from the agency or
institution; and
(ii) The waiver is made in writing and signed by the student, regardless of age.
(2) If a student has waived his or her rights under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, the educational institution shall:
(i) Give the student, on request, the names of the individuals who provided the letters and statements of recommendation; and
(ii) Use the letters and statements of recommendation only for the purpose for which they were intended.
(3)(i) A waiver under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section may be revoked with respect to any actions occurring after the revocation.
(ii) A revocation under paragraph
(c)(3)(i) of this section must be in writing.

# FERPA Clauses: 20 U.S.C. 1232g(a)(1)(A) and (B)

(A) No funds shall be made available under any applicable program to any educational agency or institution which has a policy of denying, or which effectively prevents, the parents of students who are or have been in attendance at a school of such agency or at such institution, as the case may be, the right to inspect and review the education records of their children. If any material or document in the education record of a student includes information on more than one student, the parents of one of such students shall have the right to inspect and review only such part of such material or document as relates to such student or to be informed of the specific information contained in such part of such material. Each educational agency or institution shall establish appropriate procedures for the granting of a request by parents for access to the education records of their children within a reasonable period of time, but in no case more than forty-five days after the request has been made.

(B) No funds under any applicable program shall be made available to any State educational agency (whether or not that agency is an educational agency or institution under this section) that has a policy of denying, or effectively prevents, the parents of students the right to inspect and review the education records maintained by the State educational agency on their children who are or have been in attendance at any school of an educational agency or institution that is subject to the provisions of this section.

The Hack-plan is to work on Slack and via video conference to cover these modules over the weekend as we work through a use case for the Privacy Day consent button.  i.e. Health Care Data Access.

Everyone who has an interest and can help with any of the above, from legal hacking notice requirements, to creating instructions, promoting, graphic desings, messaging, strategy,  etc. 

The plan is to model a legal hack using consent, then to create a Hack Project Kit, so that researchers, companies, and organisatons can create a Privacy Day button for their juridiction.

If there is anyone interested in facillitating one of the modules please get in touch as soon as possible to get in the loop so that we can have multiple tracks going through the weekned.

(Note:The London track is not be competing for a prize, but will still be voted on. )

# Video Intro Script ## Hackathon Project to Make a Privacy day Campaign for Jan 28 2016


Hi My name is Mark Lizar
- Createing a project for MIT Media Labs Future of Commerce - Hackathon and Un-COnference. 
- 
when I heard about this - I thought of what can be the most distruptie. 

## Point 1: Need "Consent for Commerce"

- Personal data  is the rocket fuel for the Future of Commerce but make accessible to that personal data fuel is not possible today due to lack of privacy and individual control.

A new deal on data is needed so that personal data can be used on people's own terms.  A new deal that ensure fair value exchange in the commercial marketplaces of the future. 

## Point 2: Privacy Day Campaign for Jan 28 2016 leveraging existing laws requiring consent for personal data

- Lets create a  Hackathon Project to Make a Privacy day Campaign for Jan 28 2016
- Create a massive civic campaign;  Create a project to with a broad scope of roles; writers, promoters, actavists, legal hackers, etc. 
- Make a button that people press that sends a legal request to a company to manage or control consent for the access, control and use of personal data on Privacy Day
- use the hackathon to legally hack the ideas and processes for this button

## Point 3: With legal hacking -  that creates meaningful  results around data control

## We setup some session  futurecommerce.civics.com  
- Panel on Friday night at Fab Lab in London - 5:30 - 8 
- Sat & Sun virtual and maybe local hack session on the project

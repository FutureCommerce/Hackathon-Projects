# Video Intro Script 


Hi My name is Mark Lizar
- Createing a project for MIT Media Labs Future of Commerce - Hackathon and Un-COnference. 
- when I heard about this - I thought of what can be the most distruptive for commerce.- 

## Point 1: Came up with -  "Consent for Commerce" as the Project Goal 

- Personal data  is the rocket fuel for the Future of Commerce but consent is not usable  So how do we create a new deal on data  so that people can share and access their own data on their own terms.  

## Point 2:  Lets create a Global consent button people can use to provide or take away consent for future commerce. 

## We setup some session to create this project  
- Panel on Friday night at Fab Lab in London - 5:30 - 8 
- Sat & Sun virtual and maybe local hack session on the project and project kit
- - Then Present it to see what we have come with. 

Join us now and create consent for futture of commerce -  futurecommerce.civics.com

## Hackathon Project to Make a Privacy day Campaign for Jan 28 2016

## Point 1: Need "Consent for Commerce"

- Personal data  is the rocket fuel for the Future of Commerce but make accessible to that personal data fuel is not possible today due to lack of privacy and individual control.

A new deal on data is needed so that personal data can be used on people's own terms.  A new deal that ensure fair value exchange in the commercial marketplaces of the future. 

## Point 2: Privacy Day Campaign for Jan 28 2016 leveraging existing laws requiring consent for personal data

- Lets create a  Hackathon Project to Make a Privacy day Campaign for Jan 28 2016
- Create a massive civic campaign;  Create a project to with a broad scope of roles; writers, promoters, actavists, legal hackers, etc. 
- Make a button that people press that sends a legal request to a company to manage or control consent for the access, control and use of personal data on Privacy Day
- use the hackathon to legally hack the ideas and processes for this button

## Point 3: give back control of personal data and create a button people can get out and click to make that happen. 

- What we want to hack is:
1. the ability for people to independantly manage cosnet/privacy (not have to log into cmpanies silo's)
2. ability for people to make multiple privacy/consent based requests with the press of one button. 
3. A project kit so that more button options can be made

## Point 4: a brilliant Privacy Day Campaign - legal hacking and  project kit, meaningful social results

## Point 5: Success will be measure by createing a  global revolution towards data cntrol .  . 

create as big as a scale as possible  
Present the project: Make a video/Presentation of the campaign 

This personoal data commercial rocket fuel is in effect unstable and explosive.  To refine the fuel source to make  safe, reliable and continuous access, people need control. 

To get this control we need a new deal on data and the best way to achieve that is with a successfull global privacy day  effort where people stand up to control their data.

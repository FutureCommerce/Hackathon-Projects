# Video Intro Script ## Hackathon Project to Make a Privacy day Campaign for Jan 28 2016


Hi My name is Mark Lizar
- Createing a project for MIT Media Labs Future of Commerce - Hackathon and Un-COnference. 
- when I heard about this - I thought of what can be the most distruptive.- 

## Point 1: Came up with -  "Consent for Future Commerce" as the Project Name 

- Personal data  is the rocket fuel for the Future of Commerce but today is not usable  due to lack of privacy and   individual control. 

A new deal on data is needed so that people can share data on their own terms.  

## Point 2:  Lets Create a button that providse consent and can also take it away globally and lets  launch it on the annual privacy day - Jan 28  
-  leveraging existing laws requiring consent for personal data around the world. 

## We setup some session  futurecommerce.civics.com  
- Panel on Friday night at Fab Lab in London - 5:30 - 8 
- Sat & Sun virtual and maybe local hack session on the project and project kit
- - Then Present it to see what we have come with. 

Join us now and create consent for futture consent

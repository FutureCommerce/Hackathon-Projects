## Hackathon Project to Make a Privacy day Campaign for Jan 28 2016

## Point 1: 

- Personal data  is the rocket fuel for the Future of Commerce but make accessible to that personal data fuel is not possible today due to lack of privacy and individual control.

A new deal on data is needed to protect individual's basic property rights in their personal data and ensure fair value exchange in the commercial marketplaces of the future. 

## Point 2: 

- Lets create a  Hackathon Project to Make a Privacy day Campaign for Jan 28 2016
- Call all writers, promoters, actavists, legal hackers
- The Proejct idea is to makea a massive civic campaign 
- Make a button people press that sends a legal request to a company to manage or control consent
- we will use the hackathon to legally hack the ideas and processes for this button

## Point 3: 

- two things want to hack is:
1. the ability for people to independantly manage cosnet/privacy (not have to log into cmpanies silo's)
2. ability for people to make multiple privacy/consent based requests with the press of one button. 

## Point 4: 
- The result will be a brilliant Privacy Day Campaign that we can use with the latest thinking and technologies in privacy, consent data control 
for the next Jan

## Point 5: 

This personoal data commercial rocket fuel is in effect unstable and explosive.  To refine the fuel source to make  safe, reliable and continuous access

we need a new deal on data and the best way to achieve that is with a successfull privacy day global effort along teh lines of this proposal.

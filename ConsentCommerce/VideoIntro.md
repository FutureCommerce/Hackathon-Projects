# Video Intro Script ## Hackathon Project to Make a Privacy day Campaign for Jan 28 2016


Hi My name is Mark Lizar
- Createing a project for MIT Media Labs Future of Commerce - Hackathon and Un-COnference. 
- 
when I heard about this - I thought of what can be the most distruptive.- 

## Point 1: Need "Consent for Commerce"

- Personal data  is the rocket fuel for the Future of Commerce but make accessible to that personal data fuel is not possible today due to lack of privacy and individual control.

A new deal on data is needed so that personal data can be used on people's own terms.  A new deal that ensure fair value exchange in the commercial marketplaces of the future. 

## Point 2: Lets Create a button that providse consent and can also take it away. leveraging existing laws requiring consent for personal data around the world. 


## We setup some session  futurecommerce.civics.com  
- Panel on Friday night at Fab Lab in London - 5:30 - 8 
- Sat & Sun virtual and maybe local hack session on the project
- - Then Present it to see what we have come with.

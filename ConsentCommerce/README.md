The Challenge: To Create and present a  Global Privacy Day campaign for the annual Privacy Day  that uses consent law to make a request for transparency and privacy.  

The first event is on Friday at 5:30 - 8 pm London, England - its a social with a focus on consent and it  is arranged around the kick off of the MIT Medial Labs: Future of Commerce Hackathon & Un-Conference. 

This will be held at the Fab Lab in London 
1 Frederick's Place, London, EC2R 8AE, United Kingdom

You can sign up to come to the London event at the hackathon on this webstie (https://onlinehackathon2015.sched.org/).  Or if you just want to attend the Friday night social then send an email to m.lizar@openconsentgroup.com and I will put you on the list.  

The second part of the event is the Hackathon, you do not have to participate in the hackathon to attend the Friday night social.  The hackathon will run Saturday and Sunday, where we will hack together the campaign design.

All of the sessions are posted, and will have links, and all the relevant information will be on Slack for the virtual hackathon.

Everyone who signs up to the hackathon will get a Slack invite and added  to the hackathon github repository, unless you other wise specify a different preference

* attend the hackathon sessions
* send me an email/message to add you to Slack  m.lizar@openconsentgroup.com

Background

People have become the product and our personal data the oil of the Internet.  Terms of service and consent to privacy policies are un usable and not meaningful. People do not provide real consent, and the consent that is provided is practically meaningless for people.   We either like it, or lump it.  (up until now)

As such, This Future of Commerce Hackathon project is to create an effictive Civic campaign. Using Consent Law to hack open choices and provide and easy way for companies to respond and update consent or abide by preferences on behest of the individual. 

Updated laws, new awareness, a willingess to enforce privacy law and lower tolerance by all of use people is now apparent.  The Rank Digital Rights Project (https://rankingdigitalrights.org/index2015/all-indicators/) - shows exactly how much companies care and the Special 2015 Eurobarometer report, (http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/files/factsheets/factsheet_data_protection_eurobarometer_240615_en.pdf) illustrates how much people don't like it.   

This is apparent in the market now as the use of Ad blocker has grown to the biggest (commercial) boycott in human history, the EU-US Safe Harbor treaty has disintigrated and the courts are not supporting click through terms and commercial practices based on quasi consent.   

Companies and people need new and more performative ways to control  data and privacy.   This project is the effort that aims to create them.  The Privacy Day Project is intended to provide the research and development  data to explore this.

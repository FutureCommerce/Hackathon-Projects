Consent For Commerce : 

Create a Privacy Day Campaign to support innovation and turn on real consent.  Create Real Trust

People have become the product and our personal data the oil.  Terms of service and consent to privacy policies are un usable and not meaningful. People do not provide real consent, and the consent that is provided is practically useless for people.   We either like it, or lump it.  (up until now)

As such, This Future of Commerce Hackathon project is to create a Privacy Day Campaign to change this. Using Consent Law to hack open choices.  Updated laws, new awareness, a willingess to enforce and lower tolerance by all of use people is apparent. 

The Rank Digital Rights Project (https://rankingdigitalrights.org/index2015/all-indicators/) - shows exactly how much companies care and the Special 2015 Eurobarometer report (http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/files/factsheets/factsheet_data_protection_eurobarometer_240615_en.pdf) illustrates how much people don't like it.    This is apparent in the market now as the use of Ad blocker has grown to the biggest (commercial) boycott in human history, the EU-US Safe Harbor treaty has disintigrated and the courts are not supporting click through terms and commercial practices based on quasi consent.   

We need a new way to do things.  

At the moment people can't track who has their consent, can't manage consent independantly of a service provider, and people have to manage consent with one service provider at a time.   This is not meaningful and its impossible for people to manage data sharing and have to log into to each provider seperately to manage it.

Calling everyone who cares about consent, privacy and data control to get involved in supporting this project.  Our data, and our identities are being bought, sold and harvested by an ever increasing army of companies.  

This hackathon project will use the Consent Record standard from the Kantara Initiative,  Legal Hacking, and social power to create a button that makes it clear how to access, control and manage consent.  

On Privacy Day, we want to get as many people as possible to click a privacy day button, that opens a form, that people use to configure the button for a request to a company.   a button that asks for a copy of consent and provides the company with a persons terms.

We are looking for all able bodies to help; writers/researchers, designers, developers, marketeers, promoters and evangelists. Any person who is interested in helping engineer tools so people  can  control and own their own data.  

Starting with an introduction on Friday at 6pm,  with a Sandy Pentland key note. Continuing with 3 sessions on Saturday, and two on Sunday.

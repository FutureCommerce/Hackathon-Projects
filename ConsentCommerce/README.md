The first event is on Friday at 5:30 - 8 pm London, England - its a social with a focus on consent and it  is arranged around the kick off of the MIT Medial Labs: Future of Commerce Hackathon & Un-Conference.

Background

People can't trust what we can't see.  This project is about making consent viewable. 
People have become the product and our personal data the oil of the Internet but we can't see or use the controls at the moment.  Terms of service and consent to privacy policies are un usable and not meaningful.

As such, This Future of Commerce Hackathon project is to create an effictive Civic campaign. Using Consent Law to hack open choices and provide and easy way for companies to respond and update consent or abide by preferences on behest of the individual. 

Updated laws, new awareness, a willingess to enforce privacy law and lower tolerance by all of use people is now apparent.  The Rank Digital Rights Project (https://rankingdigitalrights.org/index2015/all-indicators/) - shows exactly how much companies care and the Special 2015 Eurobarometer report, (http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/files/factsheets/factsheet_data_protection_eurobarometer_240615_en.pdf) illustrates how much people don't like it.   

This is apparent in the market now as the use of Ad blocker has grown to the biggest (commercial) boycott in human history, the EU-US Safe Harbor treaty has disintigrated and the courts are not supporting click through terms and commercial practices based on quasi consent.   

Companies and people need new and more performative ways to control  data and privacy.   This project is the effort that aims to create them.  The Privacy Day Project is intended to provide the research and development  data to explore this.

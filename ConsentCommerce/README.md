** Consent For Commerce Project ** 
http://futurecommerce.civics.com/

The Challenge: To Create and present a  Global Privacy Day campaign for the annual Privacy Day  that uses consent law to make a request for transparency and privacy.  

The first event is on Friday at 5:30 - 8 pm London, England - its a social with a focus on consent and it  is arranged around the kick off of the MIT Medial Labs: Future of Commerce Hackathon & Un-Conference. 

This will be held at the Fab Lab in London 
1 Frederick's Place, London, EC2R 8AE, United Kingdom

You can sign up to come to the London event at the hackathon on this webstie (https://onlinehackathon2015.sched.org/).  Or if you just want to attend the Friday night social then send an email to m.lizar@openconsentgroup.com and I will put you on the list.  

The second part of the event is the Hackathon, you do not have to participate in the hackathon to attend the Friday night social.  The hackathon will run Saturday and Sunday, where we will hack together the campaign design.

All of the sessions are posted, and will have links, and all the relevant information will be on Slack.

If you can make it in person the location is 
Drive Productions
14 Bowden Street
London
SE11 4DS
(Northern Line to Kennington)

Everyone who signs up to the hackathon will get a Slack invite and added  to the hackathon github repository, unless you other wise specify a different preference 

All you have to do is 
* sign up via https://onlinehackathon2015.sched.org/
* fill in your profile
* attend the hackathon sessions
* send me an email/message to add you to Slack  m.lizar@openconsentgroup.com

 The underlying goal is to experiment with creating a two way policy communication channel between the consent grantor (the person), and the grantee (the organisation)
 
This Project Hack has identified modules to plan out to be presented on Sunday
* 1. the consent legal hack pattern (spreadsheet for creating a button) 
* 2. THe UX (wire frame plan, template letter to company and dev time) 
* 3. The UX for companies (wire frame plan, template letter to people, deve time) 
* 4. The project kit to create more buttons
* 5. The Presentation of the Project


The Hack-plan is to work on Slack and via video conference to cover these modules over the weekend as we work through a use case for the Privacy Day consent button.  i.e. Health Care Data Access. 

Everyone who has an interest and can help with any of the above, from legal hacking notice requirements, to creating instructions, promoting, graphic desings, messaging, strategy,  etc.  

The plan is to model a legal hack using consent, then to create a Hack Project Kit, so that researchers, companies, and organisatons can create a Privacy Day button for their juridiction. 

If there is anyone interested in facillitating one of the modules please get in touch as soon as possible to get in the loop so that we can have multiple tracks going through the weekned. 

(Note:The London track is not be competing for a prize, but will still be voted on. )

*** Background

People have become the product and our personal data the oil of the Internet.  Terms of service and consent to privacy policies are un usable and not meaningful. People do not provide real consent, and the consent that is provided is practically meaningless for people.   We either like it, or lump it.  (up until now)

As such, This Future of Commerce Hackathon project is to create an effictive Civic campaign. Using Consent Law to hack open choices and provide and easy way for companies to respond and update consent or abide by preferences on behest of the individual. 

Updated laws, new awareness, a willingess to enforce privacy law and lower tolerance by all of use people is now apparent.  The Rank Digital Rights Project (https://rankingdigitalrights.org/index2015/all-indicators/) - shows exactly how much companies care and the Special 2015 Eurobarometer report, (http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/files/factsheets/factsheet_data_protection_eurobarometer_240615_en.pdf) illustrates how much people don't like it.   

This is apparent in the market now as the use of Ad blocker has grown to the biggest (commercial) boycott in human history, the EU-US Safe Harbor treaty has disintigrated and the courts are not supporting click through terms and commercial practices based on quasi consent.   

Companies and people need new and more performative ways to control  data and privacy.   This project is the effort that aims to create them.  The Privacy Day Project is intended to provide the research and development  data to explore this.

The Hack: On Privacy Day, we want to imagine the best campaign possible and propose it.  We want to  get as many people as possible to click a privacy day button and sign a petition, send a request, and crowdsource company consent policy.  This is imagined throug the use of an open form that is hacked at the hackathon.  The form will help people  to configure their own button for a request to a company.  

Use the Consent Record Specification from the Kantara Initiative,  Legal Hacking, and social power to create a button that makes it clear how to access, control and  enable people to manage consent.  

We will also create a response form for the company which will in effect create a consent record and response to the request in the form of a consent receipt which the individual then receives.  (see http://techscience.org/a/2015101601/)

This opens up many other possivle 'consent for commercec' hacks for people to provide their own terms for consent preferences to companies, providing the signal needed for consent based networking to companies.   

To achived and explore all the possibilities consent based netorking with companies has, this hack will also aim to ambitiously create a project kit that can be used to create and extend the consent button for additional uses, other than those identified in the hack.

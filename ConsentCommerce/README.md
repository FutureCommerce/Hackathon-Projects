** Consent For Future Commerce Project : 

The Challenge: To Create and present a Privacy Day campaign for the annual Privacy Day  that uses consent law to make a request for transparency to a company.  

The first event is on Friday at 5:30 - 8 pm London, England - its a social about consent and its use for commerce that is arranged around the kick off of the MIT Medial Labs: Future of Commerce Hackathon & Un-Conference. 

This will be held at the Fab Lab in London 
you can sign up to come to the London event at the hacathon on this webstie.  Or if you just want to attend the Friday night social then send an email to m.lizar@openconsentgroup.com and I will put you on the list.  

The second part of the event is the Hackathon, you do not have to attend the hackathon to attend teh Friday night social. 

Everyone who signs up to the hackathon will get a slack invite and added  to the hackathon github repository, unless you other wise specify a different preference 

The Project Hackathon has identified modules to plan out and present. 
1. the consent legal hack pattern (spreadsheet for creating a button) 
2. THe UX (wire frame plan, template letter to company and dev time) 
3. The UX for companies (wire frame plan, template letter to people, deve time) 
4. The project kit to create more buttons
5. The Presentation of the Project

The Hack-plan is to work on Slack and via video conference to cover these modules over the weekend as we work through a use case for the Privacy Day consent button.  I.e. Health Care. 

Everyone who has an interest and can help with any of the above, from legal hacking notice requirements, to creating instructions, promoting, making desings. etc.  

If there is anyone interested in facillitating one of the modules please get in touch as soon as possible to get in the loop. 

(Note:The London track is not be competing for a prize, but will still be voted on. )

*** Background

People have become the product and our personal data the oil of the Internet.  Terms of service and consent to privacy policies are un usable and not meaningful. People do not provide real consent, and the consent that is provided is practically meaningless for people.   We either like it, or lump it.  (up until now)

As such, This Future of Commerce Hackathon project is to create an effictive Civic campaign. Using Consent Law to hack open choices.

Updated laws, new awareness, a willingess to enforce privacy law and lower tolerance by all of use people is now apparent.  The Rank Digital Rights Project (https://rankingdigitalrights.org/index2015/all-indicators/) - shows exactly how much companies care and the Special 2015 Eurobarometer report, (http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/files/factsheets/factsheet_data_protection_eurobarometer_240615_en.pdf) illustrates how much people don't like it.   

This is apparent in the market now as the use of Ad blocker has grown to the biggest (commercial) boycott in human history, the EU-US Safe Harbor treaty has disintigrated and the courts are not supporting click through terms and commercial practices based on quasi consent.   

We need new ways to control our data and privacy. 


****

This hackathon project will use the Consent Record Specification from the Kantara Initiative,  Legal Hacking, and social power to create a button that makes it clear how to access, control and manage consent.  

On Privacy Day, we want to get as many people as possible to click a privacy day button, that opens a form, that people use to configure the button for a request to a company.   a button that asks for a copy of consent and provides the company with a persons terms.

We are looking for all able bodies to help; writers/researchers, designers, developers, marketeers, promoters and evangelists. Any person who is interested in helping engineer tools so people  can  control and own their own data.  

Starting with an introduction on Friday at 5:30 pm London Time,  with a Sandy Pentland key note. Continuing with 3 sessions on Saturday, and two on Sunday.

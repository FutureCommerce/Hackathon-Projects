Consent Commerce : 

Calling everyone who cares about consent, privacy and data control to get involved in this project.   We are looking for writers/researchers, designers, developers, marketeers, and technologist and any person who is interested in helping engineer tools so people  can  control and own their own data.  See what privacy they have.  

in this privacy day hack, we want to get as many people as possible to submit a privacy day consent request to a company, asking for consent record, is the company uses outside sources of data, sharing practices.

Themes

Can consent managmeent be used to control personal data? 
How can consent be used to increase experience, personally and as a customer? 

Research 
- Ranking Digital Rights
-   Top companies that control most of the tracking and data provide very little control to pepople
-   information that is requied to be open by law is closed
-   obsucre data collection practices
-   profiling peole collection of user information from third party data sources 
-   data retention
-   easy access to change or control any of these preferences

Solution approach is to enable people to externally and indpendantly interact with companies, this requires two new bits of consent managmmeent  innovation. 
- 1. people can send a request to a company using the law to manage personal data with consent and notice law as the commmon facilitaty 
- 2. that a person can make a request to manage personal data to multiple companies at once. 

We have two main project streams.

** Legal Hacking Notes

* Background research
* Updated laws, new awareness, a willingess to enforce privacy law and lower tolerance by all of use people is now apparent. The Rank Digital Rights Project (https://rankingdigitalrights.org/index2015/all-indicators/) - shows exactly how much companies care and the Special 2015 Eurobarometer report, (http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/files/factsheets/factsheet_data_protection_eurobarometer_240615_en.pdf) illustrates how much people don't like it.

Legal sheet for consent rules

The new data protection rules will apply to non-EU based businesses who offer their goods or services to EU customers based in the EU (or monitor their behaviour). For example a US company with a subsidiary in the EU will be required to comply with EU data protection law as well as their own local US laws.

Valid consent must be explicit for data collected and purposes data used (Article 7; defined in Article 4). Consent for children under 13 must be given by child’s parent or custodian, and should be verifiable (Article 8). Data controllers must be able to prove "consent" (opt-in) and consent may be withdrawn.[6]

    a maximum of 0.5% of annual turnover for failures such as not responding properly to requests by data subjects;
    a maximum of 1% of annual turnover for failures such as leaving inaccurate data uncorrected, or failing to adopt internal policies to comply with the new Regulation; and
    a maximum of 2% of annual turnover for the most serious violations, including “risky processing operations”, or failing to obtain data subject consent.

Consent
Another key change being proposed is that data controllers can no longer rely on implied consent. Instead, controllers will have to prove that they have been provided with “explicit” consent from the data subject, while consent may not be relied upon if there is a “clear imbalance between the data subject and the controller” (which will make it difficult for, for example, employers to rely on consent from employees, as grounds for processing).

As an alternative to obtaining explicit consent, “other legitimate interests” of a controller will provide a legal basis for processing, provided that the interests or the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject are not overriding.

Whilst this change is consistent with the opinions that have been issued by the Article 29 Working Party, this change will be particularly felt in the UK, where much of the UK Information Commissioner’s guidance has focussed on the concept of “implied consent”. For example, the Information Commissioner’s view on website privacy policies has generally been that the data controller does not need to flag up in flashing lights processing that is obvious. It will be interesting to see how guidance changes in this area. 

Notification
Controllers will no longer have to notify data protection authorities that they are processing data -instead they will be asked to make available upon request evidence demonstrating their data protection policies and procedures, including “privacy by design and default” mechanisms, and privacy impact assessments. 

***
Potentially more interesting is a new right for data subjects not to be subject to a “measure based on profiling”, meaning that organisations will be potentially barred from profiling individuals based on automatic processing seeking to predict a person’s creditworthiness, economic situation, location, health, personal preferences, reliability or behaviour. This may well impact upon Amazon’s religious beliefs patent (as blogged about by Martin last month).

It’s also worth noting that under the new proposals the processing of personal data of a child below the age of 13 years shall only be lawful if and to the extent that consent is given or authorised by the child’s parent or custodian. This concept of a “child” and the parental consent requirements will almost certainly conflict with many organisations’ current practices.

*************safe harbor 
Sensitive Data
http://export.gov/safeharbor/eu/eg_main_018375.asp

Must an organization always provide explicit (opt-in) choice with respect to sensitive data?

No, such choice is not required where the processing is:

1. in the vital interests of the data subject or another person;

2. necessary for the establishment of legal claims or defenses;

3. required to provide medical care or diagnosis;

4. carried out in the course of legitimate activities by a foundation, association or any other non-profit body with a political, philosophical, religious or trade-union aim and on condition that the processing relates solely to the members of the body or to the persons who have regular contact with it in connection with its purposes and that the data are not disclosed to a third party without the consent of the data subjects;

5. necessary to carry out the organization's obligations in the field of employment law; or

6. related to data that are manifestly made public by the individual. 

Enforcement

In order to ensure compliance with the safe harbor principles, there must be (a) readily available and affordable independent recourse mechanisms so that each individual's complaints and disputes can be investigated and resolved and damages awarded where the applicable law or private sector initiatives so provide; (b) procedures for verifying that the commitments companies make to adhere to the safe harbor principles have been implemented; and (c) obligations to remedy problems arising out of a failure to comply with the principles. Sanctions must be sufficiently rigorous to ensure compliance by the organization. Organizations that fail to provide annual self certification letters will no longer appear in the list of participants and safe harbor benefits will no longer be assured.

Notice

Organizations must notify individuals about the purposes for which they collect and use information about them. They must provide information about how individuals can contact the organization with any inquiries or complaints, the types of third parties to which it discloses the information and the choices and means the organization offers for limiting its use and disclosure.

Choice

Organizations must give individuals the opportunity to choose (opt out) whether their personal information will be disclosed to a third party or used for a purpose incompatible with the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. For sensitive information, affirmative or explicit (opt in) choice must be given if the information is to be disclosed to a third party or used for a purpose other than its original purpose or the purpose authorized subsequently by the individual.
